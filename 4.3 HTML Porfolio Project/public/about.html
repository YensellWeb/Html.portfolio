<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>It's been a long road but I want to explore more let me explain but first you have to understand my mistakes and decision and how I build my feelings stronger and how I control my brain end of the day I believe and will call it discipline, my mom always was embarrassed of me my dad left us two time, leave us with all type though but that never broke me and made me took the bad side and bad choices instead make me understand that world isn't bad at all we have to look the good things and make things right and we’re going to make mistake because we’re human of course but I mistake only is a mistake when happens more than one time, mom make me understand that someone that love you will do everything for a better future for you and will sacrifice everything for a backpack, pencil and a book so you can have a good job and better life but I wish that they can understand how the world has changed how there's a lot of way to make a better life doing what do you want and no a better life but a peace one, I wish that my mom can put the same motivation, happiness and be proud of me the same way she showed to my brother every time I looked at her and tell her something that is amazing even if it's an idea she just said Muy bien or go to college kid even become computer science which I love and everything that has to be related to web development, but I teaches myself to be what I have to be, I kick my ass to be what it has to be done to be successful to have everything that I want without look my bank account or said I want a lovely family, friends and live to enjoy I feel like I have 21 but my brain 32 its funny but it's a lot , I teach my self how be discipline, patience, focus, understand cry, be stressful, yelling, be mad, be sad will not fix the problem, the goal is find the solution so I can sleep because sometimes I cant without a solution I don't feel pressure. </p>
